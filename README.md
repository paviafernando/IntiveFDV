 Test project related to https://gist.github.com/nicopaez/511f730c68aff7ff651c39223e38763f, just a pair of simple classes to use on a Bikes rental application.

 I get sticked to the requirements, but  I've used inheritance for the Rental represetnation. With these requirements didn't see much more complexity to be added, but these classes are extensibles and scalables.

 To run the tests, just Open the Test project and use the Test Explorer to run all of them.
